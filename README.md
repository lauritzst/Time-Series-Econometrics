# Time-Series-Econometrics

## General information

This project was submitted as a personal assignment for the "Time Series Econometrics" course. The project was graded with very good and it corresponded to 30% of the final grade.

### Assignment 1

This assignment focused on the analytical derivations and concepts taught in the course. In the first task, the time series process was to be analyzed for stationarity and ergodicity. Task 2 focused on the causality and invertibility of ARMA processes and the mean, variance, and autocovariance calculation. In the third task, the log likelihood function of an AR process is derived. Finally, an empirical exercise using R studies time series data and model selection.

### Assignment 2

The second assignment deals with forecasting and estimation of time series data. In the first task, sales of chocolate are to be predicted with the help of an ARIMA model. The second task analyzes data on the Swiss census from 1885-2020.
